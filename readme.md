This is a simple Django project that I'm using to learn Django.

It handles a basic 50/30/20 budgeting rule.
This rule is a simple way to budget your money. 50% of your income goes to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings.

Project apps:
- Core: homepage, about page, contact page, ...
- *Transactions: track and categorize income and expenses, handle the 50/30/20 budgeting rule*
- *Reports: create charts, graphs based on transactions data*
- *Users: user management*
